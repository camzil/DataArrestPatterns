## DataArrestPatterns

Analysis of Chicago Arrest Records

This project examines real Chicago arrest data to uncover trends, demographic disparities, offense patterns, and shifts in policing activity over time. The notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, visualization, and interpretation of trends relevant to social and policy impact.

## Objectives of the Project
  - Clean and preprocess raw arrest records for usable structure

  - Remove irrelevant features and handle missing or corrupted values

  - Explore frequency distribution across race, location, offense type, and year

  - Identify patterns that suggest disparity or structural imbalance

  - Visualize findings for interpretability and decision-support

  - Propose potential areas for reform or community-based intervention

## Key Findings (From Notebook Analysis) 

  - Arrests disproportionately affect specific racial groups and neighborhoods
  - Several offense categories dominate arrest counts and recur consistently
  - Year-to-year arrest totals fluctuate, indicating temporal policing shifts
  - Geographical clustering may reflect over-policing in targeted districts
  - Cleaning, merging, and filtering datasets significantly improved data quality

These findings support broader questions of equity, accountability, and policy strategy regarding law enforcement.
